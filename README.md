## Hospital Pricing

## Project Overview
This is the code for my project on hospital pricing. The goal of the project was to use California chargemaster data to try and predict procedure prices using machine learning techniques. This project aims to highlight the challenges in hospital price transparency and the power of predictive modeling. 

## Data
the data was sourced from the official California chargemaster website: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/chargemasters

## Results
Struggled with large outliers but works well with average data.
